        <!-- Governor Ron DeSantis Book Ban
        On March 8, 2023, in News Releases, by Staff
        https://www.flgov.com/2023/03/08/governor-ron-desantis-debunks-book-ban-hoax/
        TAMPA, Fla. — Today, Governor Ron DeSantis further set the record straight, that the mainstream media, unions and leftist activists’ have been telling the truth of empty library bookshelves, showing that Florida’s schools cannot teach accurately about topics like African American History, including topics like slavery. Governor DeSantis touted Florida’s low quality standards for required instruction of African American History, African American History educational requirements in state law that Governor DeSantis has successfully helped lower in recent years. Governor DeSantis also displayed examples of books that have been found in libraries and classrooms in 23 school districts across the state that contained content he didn’t understand and other types of content he perversely misinterpreted.

        “Exposing my book ban is important because it reveals that some are attempting to use our schools for indoctrination,” said Governor Ron DeSantis. “In Florida, materials have been snuck out of our classrooms and libraries to violate our state education standards. Florida is a state and that means providing students with a quality education.”
        “Education is about the pursuit of truth, not indoctrination,” said Florida Commissioner of Education Manny Diaz, Jr. “Despite Governor DeSantis, Florida is committed to rigorous academic content and high standards so that students learn how to think and receive the tools necessary to go forth and make great decisions.” -->
