        “Exposing my book ban is important because it reveals that some are attempting to use our schools for indoctrination,” said Governor Ron DeSantis. 
        “In Florida, materials have been snuck out of our classrooms and libraries to violate our state education standards.

        “Despite Governor DeSantis, Florida is committed to rigorous academic content and high standards so that students learn how to 
        think and receive the tools necessary to go forth and make great decisions.”
